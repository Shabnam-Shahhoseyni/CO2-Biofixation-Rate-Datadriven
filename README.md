# Walking at the Intersection of Bioengineering, Machine Learning, and Modeling A Case Study in CO2 Biofixation

In this study, we explore the convergence of bioengineering, machine learning, and modeling in the context of CO2 biofixation. By integrating principles from these fields, we present a case study that demonstrates the potential of interdisciplinary collaboration. Leveraging machine learning techniques and modeling methodologies, we develop data-driven models to predict the CO2 biofixation rate in a microalgae system.
